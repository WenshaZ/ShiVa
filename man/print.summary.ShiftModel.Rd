\title{Print Method for Summary of ShiftModel}
\usage{
\method{print}{summary.ShiftModel}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{summary.ShiftModel}, usually returned by \code{summary(model)} where \code{model} is a \code{ShiftModel}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}
}
\value{
No return value. Called for its side effect: printing summary information to the console.
}
\description{
Prints a formatted summary of a fitted \code{ShiftModel}, including the estimated parameters (\code{alpha}, \code{sigma2}, log-likelihood, and BIC), 
as well as details of detected shifts in the optimal trait value (mean) and variance. This method is typically called on the result of 
\code{summary()} applied to an object of class \code{ShiftModel}.
