Description: This package implements statistical methods for detecting evolutionary shifts 
    in both the optimal trait value (mean) and evolutionary variance under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck 
    model. While several existing methods detect shifts in the optimal value, few consider 
    shifts in variance. ShiVa uses an L1-penalized optimization framework to identify branches 
    where shifts occur. The method includes support for measurement error. For details, see <arXiv:2312.17480>.
